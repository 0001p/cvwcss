                <h3>Soft Skills</h3>
                <p>Grew up in a mixed family where hearing spanish from my Nana and relatives grew my comprehension skills. I've played videogames all my life, 
                    and if you've played even a minute of dark souls, you know how much patience, critical thinking, and quick reaction times you have to develop to get better. Having to rely solely on myself in a 
                    remote highschool, it developed my self-starting skills and responsibility. I graduated a year early in an accelerated program, and studied psychology independently for 5 years. I've had multiple jobs and have my own 
                    clothing shop on the side, where I sell items that I've crafted or resold. From learning langauges to self-teaching myself AP calculus, I've developed an adaptable and 
                    focused learning style.</p>

                <h3>Programming</h3>
                <p>Currently longplaying Ms.Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code Python bootcamp on Udemy. Through her course I've gained experience with OOP, APIs, Pandas, sms, GUIs, Tkinter, JSON, 
                    and some beginner-level front-end(HTML, CSS). I've built many applications, my favorite being a snow and rain alert through messages letting you know to bring your
                umbrella if you need it that day!。.:☆:･'(⌒―⌒*))) </p>

                <h3>Language</h3>
                <p>Studied Korean for 6 years, and dabbled in Japanese, Italian and German. 
                    Immersing myself in different "worlds" has been theraputic and invigorating at every step.</p>

                <h3>Art</h3>
                <p>Creating detailed and visually pleasing pieces of any medium is something I've done since I was a toddler. My one painting almost sold for $200 but I decided to gift it to my
                    precious Nana.
